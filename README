includes:
configuration files
a minimal DNS server to manage node hostnames, also updates /etc/hosts

required packages:
tftpd-hpa
nfs-server
python-twisted

setup:
my layout assumes ubuntu server, but this could be adapted to any distro in theory
* a chrooted linux distro in a common place, I use /chroot/maverick (because it's ubuntu server 10.10 "maverick")
(you can use debootstrap to easily install a debian-based system in a chroot)
* a tftpboot directory in a common place, I'm currently using /tftpboot/maverick/
   * requires files: pxelinux.0, and vmlinuz+initrd from the chrooted linux
* configuration and sbin files copied to their respective locations (all non-README files map to their respective paths on the server)

commands:
* all:
(if you setup root's ssh keys with chuseradd, you can sudo this to run a command on all servers, like "sudo service apache2 restart")
run a command on all connected nodes

* chuseradd: (requires sudo/root) add a new user to the system and chroot, or update an existing user's ssh keys with the chroot
* nodes: list the hostnames and IP addresses of all connected nodes
